## Installation

In order for the application to function properly, users must install both inquirer to run the prompt and jest to run the tests. Users can install this package by going into their terminal and typing in "npm i inquirer" and "npm i jest".

## Usage

To use this application, users need to type into their terminal "node index". Once activated, the terminal will prompt questions for the user to respond. If the user cannot provide an answer, they can press enter and a default value will be implemented. After submitting all their answers, the application will generate a 'teamRoster.html' populated with their responses.
